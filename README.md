# Image Classification Workflow (Group Coursework)

## Project Overview
This repository contains a group coursework project for image classification
on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The project focuses on comparing different machine learning and deep learning
approaches (MLP, CNN, and SVM) within a complete and consistent machine learning
workflow, including preprocessing, model design, and hyperparameter tuning,
evaluation, and reporting.

## Dataset
- CIFAR-10 image dataset
- 60,000 colour images (32×32 pixels) across 10 balanced classes
- Standard train/validation/test split

## Methods
The following models were implemented and compared:
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- PCA-based RBF Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Models were evaluated using validation-based hyperparameter tuning and
final testing on a held-out test set. Performance was analysed using accuracy,
Macro-F1, confusion matrices, and training runtime.

## My Contribution
This was a group coursework project.

My primary contributions focused on **workflow organisation and reporting**, including:
- Contributing to data preprocessing and experimental setup
- Merging individual notebooks into a consistent and reproducible pipeline
- Structuring the final report in LaTeX (Overleaf)
- Ensuring consistency in terminology, figures, tables, and evaluation metrics
- Interpreting model results and explaining design choices rather than only presenting outputs

## Key Takeaways
- A clear and well-organised machine learning workflow is as important as model performance
- Explaining *why* modelling choices are made is critical for meaningful evaluation
- Consistency in preprocessing, evaluation, and presentation is essential when integrating work from multiple contributors

## Tools & Technologies
Python, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Jupyter Notebook

The final report was prepared in LaTeX (Overleaf) and exported as PDF.

## Notes
This repository reflects a coursework-based analytical project.
The emphasis is on clarity, reproducibility, and interpretation rather than production deployment.
